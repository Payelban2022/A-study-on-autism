            Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
    
    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact
with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a 
“Developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.

The 3 types of autism are: 
•	Autistic Disorder. 
•	Asperger's Syndrome. 
•	Pervasive Development Disorder.

Here we have developed a project on datasets related to ASD across globe on people of different ages and cultures.


	The data is provided on : https://payelpassionproject.s3.amazonaws.com/dataonautism/inputdata/data+on+adults.csv

We have recorded 10 behavioral features and other individual characteristics like ethnicity, gender, jaundice while birth, age of moms, family member with ASD traits that have proved to be effective in detecting ASD.

	Autism as a Disorder of Intelligence
    There have been theories about underlying connections between autism and intelligence for years. Some modern 
psychologists theorize those illustrious personalities like Bill Gates, Sir Issac Newton, Michelangelo, 
Lewis Carroll might have been autistic. So ,we must embrace it rather than ignoring it. 

	Upcoming Improvements:

•	Study and analyze the connection of autism with high intelligence.
•	Use Kafka to calculate how many individuals are using the model to test ASD.
