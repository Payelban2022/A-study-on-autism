Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD)
    Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact
with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a 
“developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life.

The 3 types of autism are: 
Autistic Disorder. 
Asperger's Syndrome. 
Pervasive Development Disorder.

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a guide created by the 
American Psychiatric Association that health care providers use to diagnose mental disorders, people with ASD often have:

Difficulty with communication and interaction with other people
Restricted interests and repetitive behaviors
Symptoms that affect their ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life

Autism is known as a “spectrum” disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people
experience.

People of all genders, races, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds can be diagnosed with ASD. Although ASD can be a 
lifelong disorder, treatments and services can improve a person’s symptoms and daily functioning. The American Academy 
of Pediatrics recommends that all children receive screening for autism. Caregivers should talk to their child’s health
care provider about ASD screening or evaluation.

The rapid growth in the number of ASD cases worldwide necessitates datasets related to behaviour traits. However, such
datasets are rare making it difficult to perform thorough analyses to improve the efficiency, sensitivity, specificity 
and predictive accuracy of the ASD screening process. Presently, very limited autism datasets associated with clinical 
or screening are available and most of them are genetic in nature. Hence, we propose a new dataset related to autism 
screening of toddlers that contained influential features to be utilised for further analysis especially in determining
autistic traits and improving the classification of ASD cases. In this dataset, we record ten behavioural features
(Q-Chat-10) plus other individuals characteristics that have proved to be effective in detecting the ASD cases from 
controls in behaviour science.

'Q-Chat-10'
'Q-CHAT-10' Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers 
A quick referral guide for parents to complete about their toddler (18 – 24 months) with concerns about autism.

SCORING: For questions 1-9: if you circle an answer in columns C, D or E, score 1 point per question.

For question 10: if you circle an answer in columns A, B or C, score 1 point. 
Add points together for all ten questions.

If your child scores more than 3 out of 10, the health professional may consider referring your child for a
multidisciplinary assessment.


The remaining features in the datasets are collected from the “submit” screen in the ASDTests screening app. It should 
be noted that the class variable was assigned automatically based on the score obtained by the user while undergoing 
the screening process using the ASDTests app


Autism spectrum quotient (AQ-10) test
The autism spectrum quotient (AQ-10) tool is recommended for use with adults with possible autism who do not have a 
moderate or severe learning disability. This may help identify whether an individual should be referred for a 
comprehensive autism assessment.

For each item, please circle the response which best applies :
Definitely Agree, Slightly Agree,Slightly Disagree,Definitely Disagree

1.I often notice small sounds when others do not

2.I usually concentrate more on the whole picture, rather than the small details

3.I find it easy to do more than one thing at once

4.If there is an interruption, I can switch back to what I was doing very quickly

5.I find it easy to ‘read between the lines’ when someone is talking to me

6.I know how to tell if someone listening to me is getting bored

7.When I’m reading a story I find it difficult to work out the characters’ intentions

8.I like to collect information about categories of things (e.g. types of car, types of bird, types of train, 
types of plant etc)

9.I find it easy to work out what someone is thinking or feeling just by looking at their face

10.I find it difficult to work out people’s intentions

SCORING: Only 1 point can be scored for each question. Score 1 point for Definitely or Slightly Agree on each of items 
1, 7, 8, and 10. Score 1 point for Definitely or Slightly Disagree on each of items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 9. If the 
individual scores more than 6 out of 10, consider referring them for a specialist diagnostic assessment.

We will analyze 2 datasets relating to datasets on toddlers and adults.
